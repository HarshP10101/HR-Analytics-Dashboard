# 📊 HR Analytics Dashboard  
🚀 *Understanding Employee Attrition with Data-Driven Insights*  

## 🔍 Backstory: Why I Built This Dashboard?  

While reading about **India’s IT sector**, I came across reports stating that **major companies like Infosys, Wipro, and TCS were struggling with high employee turnover rates** – some exceeding **20%** annually.  

Attrition wasn't just about employees leaving; it was impacting **business continuity, recruitment costs, and productivity**. HR teams needed **a data-driven way to analyze attrition trends** and uncover the key factors behind why employees were leaving.  

That’s when I decided to build an **HR Analytics Dashboard** in **Power BI** 💡 – to analyze employee attrition patterns, pinpoint high-risk segments, and help organizations make **better retention decisions** using **data insights.**
